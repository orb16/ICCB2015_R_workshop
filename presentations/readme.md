# ICCB 2015 participants: welcome!

The pdf files are the presentation files I'll be running off. It is best if you download the whole folder (clone or download the zip, option to the right) as then you'll be able to use the relative paths specified in the files (e.g., data is in the data folder). Looking forward to meeting you all.

Best wishes,

Olivia
