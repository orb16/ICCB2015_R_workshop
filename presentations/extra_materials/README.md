## ggplot extra materials: guide to files 

Welcome to the ggplot2 tutorial files! 


__Beginners:__
We suggest if you have not encountered ggplot before, you start with the r script "seminar_6_ggplot_beginner.R" (and its accompanying answers file). 

__Intermediate:__
If you've done a bit of plotting in ggplot you may wish to follow the "seminar\_6\_ggplot\_intermediate" - either the .Rmd, or if you prefer, just follow using the pdf version.  


__Phylopic, NMDS visualisation and GGpairs:__
"ggplot\_extended\_A"

__Spatial data:__
"ggplot\_extended\_B"

__Overdispersion in GLMMs:__
"overdisp_notes.html" 
The data is in the "owls.txt" file in the same folder (there is code to download it from the website, but I have put the .txt file in there just in case).

__Materials originally presented__ by Jennifer Bufford and Olivia Burge at the Lincoln and Canterbury ggplot seminars respectively.  See https://github.com/orb16/seminaRs/ for all the seminar materials.
