Description:
  1.1.1	Forest Service Mapping Series 6 (FSMS6)
  
  The 23 completed maps provide the distribution of indigenous forest vegetation
  for all of the North Island and the bulk of the South Island at a scale of
  1:250,000. These maps were primarily compiled by Mr John Nicholls with some of
  the South Island maps compiled by Mr Dudley Franklin. Black and white aerial
  photographs, dating from 1948 to 1955 and at a scale of 15 chains per inch,
  supplemented by extensive ground truthing and some 16,000 National Forest Survey
  and Ecosurvey plots, were used to determine forest class boundaries. These were
  transferred to 1:63360 topographic maps. The maps were field checked and then
  copied for production by FRI graphics staff (Herbert 1997, pers. comm.).
  
  Most maps were completed by the NZ Forest Service, with a small number being
  finished by the Ministry of Forestry and then by Landcare Research Ltd. Appendix
  1 gives the list of maps digitised. The date of the photographs that were used
  to compile each map is not known exactly.
  
  1.1.2	Forest Service Mapping Series 15 (FSMS15)
  
  There are two FSMS15 comprising 1:1,000,000 maps of the North Island, and South
  Island (including Stewart Island). These were compiled by NZFS Conservancy and
  Head Office staff for the 1974 Forestry Development Conference. Forest
  boundaries for the 1:1,000,000 FSMS15 maps are significantly less accurate than
  those for the 1:250,000 FSMS6 maps (Herbert and Nicholls, 1997, pers. comm.).
  Data sources included existing FSMS6 maps (with 18 classes coalesced into eight
  super classes), local published and unpublished maps and local knowledge for
  areas not cover by the FSMS6. The Te Anau, Hauroko and Mataura FSMS6 series maps
  were substituted for by the South Island FSMS15 map.
  
  1.1.3	Forest Service Type Map Series No. 2 (FSTM2)
  
  These are a collection of detailed forest class maps at 1:63360 scale. Coverage
  is confined to parts of the central North Island.
  
   1.1.4	Vegetation  of Stewart Island
  
  Mr Hugh Wilson (Wilson, 1987) developed a detailed map of the vegetation of
  Steward Island. Wilson’s Podocarp/hardwood forest, and rata-kamahi hardwood
  forest polygons (Types A 1-2, B3) were digitised.
  
  1.2	Forest Class Description
  
  There are eighteen forest classes described in the FSMS6 map series. These are
  described in Table 1. The source is Nicholls and Herbert (1995). FSMS15 has
  eight super classes and these are defined in Table 2.

  2.	METHODS
  2.1	Digitising and Topology Generation
  
  The maps were digitised by staff at the Forest Research Institute under
  standards listed in Appendix 2, using the Terrasoft Geographic Information
  System. The linear features that made up each forest class polygon are shared
  between two feature classes one, called NZFS6 which contains the national
  coverage, and the other based on the respective map sheet number. This allows
  themes to be developed for a national view and also for the individual map
  sheets.
  
  The line work is topologically correct with no over-, or under- shoots.
  
  Each polygon has a nationally unique identifier and which is linked to a dbase
  table containing a code letter which describes the forest vegetation class.
  
  These maps were digitised for the purpose of providing indigenous forest
  vegetation cover for usage at a national scale. There has been no formal
  checking of the accuracy of the digitised linework. Any errors are considered to
  be insignificant for determining a 1990 indigenous forest vegetation baseline
  database. Each polygon was checked to confirm correct tagging. During that
  process any significant linear differences were noted and corrected.
  
  2.2	Problems
  
  2.2.1	Incorrect map details
  
  In several places errors on the maps were found. Either the FSTM2 maps were
  consulted for greater detail where coverage existed or Mr John Nicholls was,
  personally,  consulted and the error corrected.
  
  2.2.2	Map source quality
  
  Most FSMS6 maps where unused, unfolded sheets with only sheet 12 being an unused
  folded map. The FSMS15 South Island map was a well used map with significant
  fold lines. This map also had other printed information which made precise
  measurement of some forest class boundaries difficult. 
  
  
  Standards
  
  This document defines the standards used for digitising the forest class maps
  (NZFS Map Series 6, FSMS15 and Wilson, 1987).
  
  Source
  The source of the FSMS6 data is the 1:125,000 flat map sheets, the FSMS15 maps
  and the Vegetation map contained in Wilson (1987).
  
  Digitising
  The following digitising standards were used.
  
  A minimum of five points for registration should be selected from a rectangular
  range encapsulating the immediate digitising area.
  These points then should he entered into Convert and both the input and the
  resultant NZMG coordinates checked before the map is registered.
  The registration error should be (in Terrasoft) 0.00%.
  The media should be anchored firmly to the digitiser. The RMU laboratory should
  be used with the air conditioning turn on.
  Registration should occur at least twice a day, but occur more frequently if the
  humidity changes.
  All lines and polygon which represent a forest type needs to be captured
  irrespective of size.
  All intersections should have a node digitised.
  The two feature classes are NZFS6 and NZFS6_<sheet number>; NZFS15, and SI_WIL
  respectively.
  All joins to lines must be done to the actual point not the nearest digitised
  node, (touch line is preferable to snap).
  The polygon construction method should be used for small polygons, though care
  must be used in the final close to ensure correct shape is retained.
  The line to be digitised, for a boundary defined by the bush symbol, is along
  the top of the symbol. Where the bush symbol changes direction care does need to
  be taken. In a convex direction change the above is true, but in a sharp concave
  (cave shaped) direction change the vertexes of the line may well go through the
  ‘base of the symbol.
  
  Output
  Shape must be identical
  
  Theme creation
  A Theme will be created for each map sheet.
  The national NZFS6 theme will be created by including the previously digitised
  map sheets and the FSMS15 and Wilson’s map.
  Polygon tags are to be corrected between the map sheets to make them all
  unique.
  All dangles and overlaps, and bad polygons are to be corrected.
  
  Tagging
  All polygons are to be tagged with a code representing the forest type.
  All sliver polygons are to be removed.
  
  Checking
  A plot should be created at the original scale and overlayed over the original
  map. Each polygon is checked to confirm correct tagging.
